            <p>It might not be time to dive into Natasha's past just yet, but it is time to check out all the brand new Black Widow products!

                Ahead of the release of Marvel Studios’ Black Widow, take a look at a new batch of clothing, toys, home goods, and everything in-between tied to the upcoming film starring Scarlett Johansson, who once again reprises her role as Natasha Romanoff in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 
                
                After seven appearances spanning a decade in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Natasha Romanoff, aka, Black Widow, takes the lead in an adventure unlike any other she’s known before. When a dangerous conspiracy reveals connections to her forgotten past, Black Widow embarks on an incredible journey across the globe, all the while being pursued by the deadly Taskmaster, an assassin hellbent on destroying the Black Widow.
                
                Along with Johansson, the film also stars Florence Pugh as Yelena, David Harbour as Alexei (aka The Red Guardian), and Rachel Weisz as Melina; the movie is directed by Cate Shortland and produced by Kevin Feige. Black Widow marks the first film in Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe!
